# politician-tests

## why
* cypress has great debugging tools when you use `cypress open`

you could also use microsoft edge or firefox with minimal changes to the code

year of birth, but shows the whole date
year of birth field doesn't have id
button doesn't have id
position should not be hidden text
there are only data validation messages (feedback) on url, should be on all
the technical test's description metioned date of birth is in mm/dd/yyyy format, but in the form it is in dd/mm/yyyy format. not sure which one is correct
fields should be mandatory, but it seems like we can still submit the form without them

written for unix system

## Requirements
* node, npm
* chrome browser
